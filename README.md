# basic_nn
Basic Single Layer Neural Network. Written in Python and commented. 
Runs a training loop where it performs back propagation and standard gradient descent to update the weights.

Inspired by [this blog post](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).

If you have numpy installed globally, you can simply run `python3 nn.py`.

If not then you can run with pipenv:

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ python nn.py
```
